TODO:
- Doesn't seem to exit once converged, check all thresholds etc... (is it because checking sum of innovations for only one target??)
       Maybe need to based the exit criteria on the measurement error param??
- Remove reliance on init location estimations. Should be able to initialise filter with no observations, then let it add?
        Otherwise, needs to wait for at least one observation before it fires up. Client would start it once there were enough targets/observations to process.
                   Or, make the library it more like, constantly running, waiting for obs (I think the client should implement this logic
- Add in TDOA, make sure it innovates correctly
- Run all test scenarios
      - True Target locations dont move in tracking tests.
      - testMoverNorthEast() algorithm not runnning, avail for future. is not running for some reasons
- Just seems to now be an issue to balance out tdoa vs aoa. tdoa takes over too much. Also, since aoa measures are not relatively strong, innovations to the correct branch are known but not actioned.
        Need to consider a proper normalisation strategy.
- CEP expanding?  - could be just the additive process noise
NOTE: May be error in residual calculation, Math.abs bracket in the wrong location, may apply in efusionlib also
- Generate demonstration schedule. specific tests to run and why
- If I have known asset locations, cant I request that they tdoa me? Other platforms, depending how confident they are with position, could be an asset also?


FUTURE:
- ?Support a mode, where it just exits after a configurable time, or on user command. Don't try to exit when innovations become low?
  More like supporting operator simply trying any and all combinations until they perceive it as accurate
- In future, support the ability to automatically, gradually reduce measurement error parameter. Or set it based on the actually confidence in the measurements themselves
       // Interesting experiment is to set X_rand_factors to 0.0, then set measurement error to 0.01, notice the result becomes very accurate to true


DONE:
- Attempt to plot hyperbolas from point and known focal length only - Use R code for experimenting [ DOESNT SEEM POSSIBLE]
- Bug: All AOA (even in efusionlib), f_meas (Adj) appear to be half of d?? Yes, simply a problem with printing out the f_meas value when converting degrees to radians. Accidentally was dividing by 360.
- Allow true location on plots
- Seems to get stuck using one observation, goes from utilising all obs to one single one - Bug form adding additional tgts to state, was exiting fix mode before allowing all innovation obs to be processed
- Target reconfiguration validation, has ID, Name etc...
- Check pressure angle fix is applying correctly to movers
- Is there some issue with covariance data for two targets??
- Plot Hyperbolas, doesnt appear possible
