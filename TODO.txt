- tracking mode
    - TODO, stop currently active thread if any, but preserve its state if it was running
- CEPs
- pick a start point that is as orthogonal to all sensor positions as possible
- TODO, also need a method for managing/expiring old observations
- TODO, experiment with measurement noise, R param to convert in sticky situations
- Filter speed property
- Need ability to delete unneeded observations (imagine user on a client system selects those to use, those to avoid),
  then just either keeps updating by asset/geoid key, or deleting in the live filter respectively

- Add tests
- Add mathcode/simulations

- Normalise each type of measurement
